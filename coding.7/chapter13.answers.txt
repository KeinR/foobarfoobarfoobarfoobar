Your name: Orion Musselman
Question 2: About 16,000 in system, and roughly 1,200 free. This checks. Most is 
being used for cache. "Free" is underutilized memory.
Question 4: It changes by the megabytes I give memory-user. That memory returns 
when I kill the process. They match my expectations. When I use large amounts of 
memory, my system will likely crash due to how I have it configured (no swap 
Linux machine, something unpredictable will happen). Don't go running around 
assuming everyone has a system with fault tolerance to daze a sysadmin.
Question 6: I got the process IDs with pgrep. `pgrep firefox`, `pgrep bash`, 
`pgrep sway`
Question 7: It looks like there are libraries and other processes as a part of 
the program. Sway, which is launched from bash, looksl ike it has some bash 
address in it. It also looks like the segments have permissions, sizes, and a 
host of other attributes to them. There are also data files, such as font files 
and such.
Question 8: The memory map is very simple. It looks like it is using the libc 
and linux shared libraries, and the rest is stack, "anonymous" and some specific 
to the process. One section, designated read write, looks like it is the segment 
that contains the massive array. The massive array also is very "dirty," perhaps 
indicating that it is constantly being modified and thus cannot be cached. Yes, 
it matches my expectations.
